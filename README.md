# RESTful APIs - Final Project

This repository contains the final project for the **RESTful APIs** course, covering API creation, MongoDB setup, frontend development, and more. The project was completed under the guidance of Dr. Michael Litman, the Chair of the Computer Science Department at Concordia University.

## Course Overview

### Unit I: All About APIs (1 week)
In this unit, we explored the fundamentals of APIs, their importance in modern web development, and how they enable communication between different services.

### Unit II: MongoDB Setup and Intro to MERN (1 week)
We set up MongoDB and introduced the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). We also learned how to interact with databases and integrate them into our applications.

### Unit III: Creating an API (2 weeks)
In this unit, we learned how to design and implement an API using Node.js and Express. We also explored concepts such as RESTful APIs, request handling, and error management.

### Unit IV: Creating a Frontend (2 weeks)
The frontend was developed using React. We focused on building responsive, dynamic user interfaces and integrating them with the backend API.

### Unit V: Final Project & Exam (2 weeks)
For the final project, we applied all the skills learned throughout the course to create a fully functional web application using the MERN stack. The final exam tested our ability to apply these skills in real-world scenarios.

## Project Details

- **Tech Stack**: MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js (MERN)
- **Objective**: Create a full-stack web application with a functional backend API and a responsive frontend.
